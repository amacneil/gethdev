A development wrapper for Ethereum's geth command.

**NOTE: This project is no longer being actively maintained. If you are interested in being a maintainer of it, please open a GitHub issue and let me know.**

### What is this?

Do you want to run a private Ethereum testnet?

Do you want to automatically mine blocks when there are pending transactions, then pause mining to give your laptop fan a break while you go back to developing your smart contract?

**gethdev** makes this easy.

gethdev is a small wrapper around the `geth` command, which automatically sets some parameters to create a private test blockchain, and runs a [JavaScript file](https://github.com/amacneil/gethdev/blob/master/gethdev.js) to automatically create the first account, and start and stop mining as needed.

Mining will be enabled:

* Initially until your default (etherbase) account has been funded with at least 100 ether.
* Every time there are pending transactions, until they have 5 confirmations.

### Install gethdev

First, you must [install geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Building-Ethereum) (OSX commands below, see link for more information or other platforms):

```sh
brew tap ethereum/ethereum
brew install ethereum
```

Next, install `gethdev`:

```sh
npm install -g gethdev
```

### Create a private blockchain

First, make sure you close [Ethereum Wallet (Mist)](https://github.com/ethereum/mist), and any other apps which may be running `geth` in the background.

Then, open a terminal and start `gethdev`:

```sh
gethdev
```

That's it! You don't need to mess around with creating a custom genesis block file, or manually create your default account.

This will run the command `geth --dev js /usr/local/lib/node_modules/gethdev/gethdev.js` (using the correct location for `gethdev.js` on your computer). You will see some output from the command, as `geth` creates a new private blockchain for you, creates the first account, and begins mining:

```

From the output, we can see that `geth` has started the IPC service at `~/Library/Ethereum/geth.ipc` (OSX). This happens to be the default location that Ethereum Wallet (Mist) will try to connect, so now you can go ahead and start up the wallet and you should see it connected to your private testnet, with some ether all ready for you.

![Mist Wallet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amacneil/gethdev/master/wallet.png)

> NOTE: The blockchain data is stored in a temporary folder by default, such as `/var/folders/5y/wb6jwkcs0_91r2fnnxg8r69r0000gn/T/ethereum_dev_mode`. If you wish to specify a custom location for the data, use the `--datadir` command line option (see below). When you specify `--datadir`, it will also move the location of the `geth.ipc` file, so if you still intend to connect to it from Ethereum Wallet, you will need to also specify the IPC path using `--ipcpath ~/Library/Ethereum/geth.ipc` (or the equivalent path for your platform).

### Running custom commands

By default, gethdev will run the command `geth js gethdev.js`, which will run the auto-mining script. If you want to run custom commands, simply pass them to `gethdev` and they will be run instead. For example:

```sh
gethdev --help # shows help screen
gethdev console # runs the default console
gethdev --datadir ./data --ipcpath ~/Library/Ethereum/geth.ipc js gethdev.js # specify a custom data directory
```

Note that `gethdev.js` will automatically be replaced with the full path in the example above.

### Attach to a running gethdev

Now that you have `gethdev` running in one window, you might want to run some commands manually against it. You can do this by opening another terminal, then simply typing:

```sh
gethdev attach
```

This will give you a JavaScript console, attached to the existing running `gethdev` instance.

### I always need to specify heaps of arguments to geth

I feel your pain! Now you can simply set a `GETHDEV_OPTS` environment variable, and they will be automatically included when you run `gethdev`.

```sh
# add GETHDEV_OPTS to your profile:
echo export GETHDEV_OPTS="--port 12345" >> ~/.bash_profile
# close and reopen your terminal window, then:
gethdev
```

This will automatically run the command `geth --dev --port 12345 js gethdev.js`, and save your fingers from RSI.

### Why do I need to install this with npm?

You don't! If you want, simply download [gethdev.js](https://github.com/amacneil/gethdev/blob/master/gethdev.js) to your computer, then run it manually by calling:

```sh
geth --dev js /path/to/gethdev.js
```

The purpose of the npm package is simply to bundle it up and make everything easy for you.
